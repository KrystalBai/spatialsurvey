				// 	<h2>Facilities Services Campus Movement Survey</h2>
				// 	<p>Facilities Services is responsible for planning and carrying out strategic improvements to buildings and grounds on campus.  From time to time, we carry out surveys to help us understand where to place future improvements.</p>
				// 	<p>Information gathered from previous surveys helped guide decisions to:</p>
				// 	<ul>
				// 		<li>Remove barriers between the main campus and Ellis Avenue by opening a pathway through the Admin building.</li>
				// 		<li>Extend the pedestrian campus East along 58th Street to Booth.</li>
				// 		<li>Illuminate the Midway with light poles.</li>
				// 		<img src="../images/midway.jpg"/>						
				// 	</ul>
				// 	<p>This survey, in turn, will help us decide where to place paths, bike racks, entryways, and other pedestrian improvements, as well as building improvements such as coffee shops, etc.</p>
