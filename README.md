spatialsurvey
=============

Spatialsurvey is a survey platform for geographic/spatial queries built using the Google Maps Javascript API.

Spatialsurvey is extremely lightweight with few dependencies other than the Google Maps Javascript API itself (it doesn't even depend on jQuery).

Spatialsurvey exports two modules, spatialsurvey, and mapcalc.
